            <h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Albert Einstein's life:</h2>
            <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
                <br>
                <li><b>1879</b> - Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, to Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch. He was the first of two children, with a younger sister named Maria.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1894</b> - Einstein's family moved to Milan, Italy, when his father's business failed. He later stayed in Munich, Germany, to continue his education. He began to show a great interest in mathematics and physics at an early age.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1900</b> - After attending the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Einstein graduated in 1900 with a degree in physics and mathematics. He faced difficulties in securing a teaching job, and instead, he took a position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1905</b> - In what is called Einstein’s "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers in the journal *Annalen der Physik*. These papers included his theory of the photoelectric effect, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, his special theory of relativity, and the famous equation E=mc².</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1915</b> - Einstein presented his general theory of relativity, an extension of his special theory of relativity, which proposed that gravity is a result of the curvature of space and time. This theory revolutionized our understanding of the universe.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1919</b> - Einstein gained international fame when British astronomers led by Arthur Eddington confirmed his prediction that light from stars is bent by gravity, thus verifying the general theory of relativity.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1933</b> - As the Nazis rose to power in Germany, Einstein, who was Jewish, emigrated to the United States. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he would spend the remainder of his career.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1939</b> - Einstein, along with fellow physicist Leo Szilard, wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning of the potential for Nazi Germany to develop an atomic bomb. This letter helped lead to the establishment of the Manhattan Project.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1940</b> - Einstein became a U.S. citizen but remained politically active, advocating for civil rights, disarmament, and pacifism. He was outspoken against racism and segregation, becoming a supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1945</b> - After World War II, Einstein continued to be an advocate for peace and the responsible use of atomic energy. He was a member of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, working to promote nuclear disarmament.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1952</b> - In 1952, Einstein was offered the presidency of Israel, but he declined, citing his lack of experience in political matters. He continued to focus on theoretical physics, his advocacy for peace, and his support for the civil rights movement in the United States.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1955</b> - Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76. His death was attributed to an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His funeral was private, and his brain was later preserved for scientific study, although it remains a subject of controversy.</li>

			<p class="font"><i>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death." — Albert Einstein</p>
